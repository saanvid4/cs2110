Name(s) and NetID(s) of group members:
sd722 and rmc329
Time spent on the assignment, in hours: 20

Implementation strategy:
We each decided to do different parts of the assignment, with one partner focusing greatly on
implementation, and one partner focusing greatly on testing and debugging. This was a good strategy
so we could work hand in hand on solving issues that occured.
    (describe how you went about implementing the assignment and how the work was divided between the partners.)


Testing strategy:
In order to receive maximum coverage, we decided to test as many edge cases and scenarios as
possible. This includes all of the rules of pente, and all of the invalid moves.
    (how did you perform testing and design test cases to achieve coverage?)

Known problems:
None
    (are there any things that do not work?)

Comments on the assignment: I thought this assignment was very hard and long, and slightly more
confusing than the last four assignments.
