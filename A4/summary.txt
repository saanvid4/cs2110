Time spent on the assignment, in hours: 20

Implementation strategy:
(describe how you went about implementing the assignment and how the work was divided between the partners.)

We decided to use Pair programming, which was suggested by the a4 handout. We allowed one partner to
write the code and the other partner revised and gave ideas for what to write. We decided to do the
assignment exactly in the order described in the handout, and ran tests for PhDTree before main.

Testing strategy:
We implemented PhDTree tests at the same time as we implemented methods in PhDTree. This allowed us
to debug in an easier manner. We decided to test all the edge cases and create three of our own methods
to test each method we implemented in PhdTree.
(how did you perform testing and design test cases to achieve coverage?)

Known problems: None
    (are there any things that do not work?)
